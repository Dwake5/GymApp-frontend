# GymApp
Track and record workouts and your weight

This project was made by Danny Wakeling, it is the final project after the culmination of 12 weeks of studying at Flatiron School's bootcamp. It was created in 2 and a half weeks and showcased on the 10th July in front of a wide audience for a few hours.

It is a gym supplement app, that seeks to let people record their workouts and see their progression over time. 

Items appended with a *, are stretch goals. 

A user can:
Create a new workout routie, which will then act as a template for future workouts.
Record sets and weight lifted and repitions (done)
See past workouts (done)
Enter their body weight 
Can singup and login (done)
See a graph of past weights * 
Input ORM's and set workout weight based on them *
See videos and/or instructions for each exercise *
Find ranked exercises | based on each muscle group *
Enter daily calories and macro's *

The app uses Rails as a backend and React for the front end.
